## 🚀 How to Run

### Quick Start

- **Just open `index.html` in your web browser** to play the game.
- No build step or server is required for basic use.

### Built-in Demo

This fork includes a small in-page "Play Demo" button (top-left) that runs a scripted playback showing the game UI, hints, difficulty changes and an automatic win demonstration. Use this to preview the UI without recording or external videos.

### Recommended: Run with a Local Server

Some browsers restrict loading local images/scripts due to security.  
To avoid this, you can use a simple local server:

**Using Python (pre-installed on most systems):**
```sh
cd /path/to/Memory-Game/Memory-Game
python3 -m http.server 8080
```
Then open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser or go to file and double click on index.html.

**Or use [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension in VS Code.**
